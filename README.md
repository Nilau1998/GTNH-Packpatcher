# GTNH-Packpatcher
Packpatcher based on the docker setup from ywempirer on the GTNH Discord

These scripts are there to help updating a GTNH server to a new pack version. Download the pack, and put it in modspacks, afterwards adjust the docker-compose file with the zip file name.

Once done you can run `. update_pack.sh` and the pack will be updated. I don't take responsibility if you lose your world, backup it manually beforehand if you feel unsure about the scripts.
